      # If running in Docker, localhost refers to the container itself. 
      # For browser access (client-side), localhost is fine if specific ports are exposed.
      # But for SSR (server-side), Frontend container needs to reach Backend container.
      # We usually use the service name 'backend' for SSR, but 'localhost' for client-side.
      # This duality often requires public env vars for client and internal for server.
      # For simplicity here, we assume client-side access mainly.
